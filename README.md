# my simple TextRank Text Summarization

Welcome to the TextRank Text Summarization project! This repository contains an implementation of the TextRank algorithm, a variant of Google's PageRank algorithm, applied to text summarization. Originally developed as a part of my university project, I've revisited and enhanced the implementation to showcase how TextRank can effectively extract key information from text documents.

About TextRank for Text Summarization
TextRank is a graph-based algorithm that leverages the structure of a text to identify and rank important sentences, producing a concise and coherent summary. By treating sentences as nodes in a graph and using a modified PageRank algorithm, TextRank can efficiently summarize large bodies of text.
